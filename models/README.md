# Model card for Virchow

Virchow is a self-supervised vision transformer pretrained using 1.5M whole slide histopathology images. The model can be used as a tile-level feature extractor (frozen or finetuned) to achieve state-of-the-art results for a wide variety of downstream computational pathology use cases.

  - Params (M): 632
  - Image size: 224 x 224
- **Model Architecture:**
  - Architecture: ViT-H/14
  - Patch size: 14
  - Layers: 32
  - Embedding dimension: 1280
  - Activation function: SwiGLU
  - Attention heads: 16
  - LayerScale: true
- **Training Details:**:

  - Objective: DINOv2 (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2304.07193)
- **Paper:**
  - A foundation model for clinical-grade computational pathology and rare cancers detection: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03141-0
- **Pretraining Dataset:** Internal dataset of 1.5 million whole slide images from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, tiles sampled at 0.5 microns per pixel resolution (20x magnification).
- **License:** Apache 2.0

## Model Usage

### Requirements
  - PyTorch (2.0+ recommended)
  - timm (>= 0.9.11 required)
  - huggingface_hub

### Login
After gaining access to the model here, you will need to login to HuggingFace in the environment you wish to use the model. This can be done from the command line:

```
huggingface-cli login
```

or in your Python code:

```python
from huggingface_hub import login

login()
```

Please refer to official HuggingFace [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/quick-start#authentication) for more details.

### Image Embeddings
```python
import timm
import torch
from timm.data import resolve_data_config
from timm.data.transforms_factory import create_transform
from timm.layers import SwiGLUPacked
from PIL import Image

# need to specify MLP layer and activation function for proper init
model = timm.create_model("hf-hub:paige-ai/Virchow", pretrained=True, mlp_layer=SwiGLUPacked, act_layer=torch.nn.SiLU)
model = model.eval()

transforms = create_transform(**resolve_data_config(model.pretrained_cfg, model=model))

image = Image.open("/path/to/your/image.png")
image = transforms(image).unsqueeze(0)  # size: 1 x 3 x 224 x 224

output = model(image)  # size: 1 x 257 x 1280

class_token = output[:, 0]    # size: 1 x 1280
patch_tokens = output[:, 1:]  # size: 1 x 256 x 1280

# concatenate class token and average pool of patch tokens
embedding = torch.cat([class_token, patch_tokens.mean(1)], dim=-1)  # size: 1 x 2560
```
We concatenate the class token and the mean patch token to create the final tile embedding. In more resource constrained settings, one can experiment with using just class token or the mean patch token. For downstream tasks with dense outputs (i.e. segmentation), the `256 x 1280` tensor of patch tokens can be used.

We highly recommend running the model on a GPU in mixed precision (`fp16`) using `torch.autocast`:

```python
model = model.to("cuda")
image = image.to("cuda")

with torch.inference_mode(), torch.autocast(device_type="cuda", dtype=torch.float16):
  output = model(image)

class_token = output[:, 0]
patch_tokens = output[:, 1:]

embedding = torch.cat([class_token, patch_tokens.mean(1)], dim=-1)

# the model output will be fp32 because the final operation is a LayerNorm that is ran in mixed precision
# optionally, you can convert the embedding to fp16 for efficiency in downstream use
embedding = embedding.to(torch.float16)
```

## Use

### Direct use
Virchow intended to be used as a frozen feature extractor as the foundation for tile-level and whole slide-level classifiers.

### Downstream use
Virchow can be finetuned to adapt to specific tasks and/or datasets.
